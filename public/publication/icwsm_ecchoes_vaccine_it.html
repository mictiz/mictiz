<meta name="description" content="Italy was the first European country to be hit by COVID-19 in the early 2020, since then losing over 100,000 people to the disease. By the end of the vaccination campaign of 2021, 81% of the public received at least one dose. These dramatic developments were accompanied by a rigorous discussion around vaccination, both about its urgency and its possible negative effects. Twitter is one of the most popular social media platforms in the country, but pre-pandemic vaccination debate has been shown to be polarized and siloed into echo chambers. It is thus imperative to understand the nature of this discourse, with a specific focus on the vaccination hesitant individuals, whose healthcare decisions may affect their communities and the country at large. In this study we ask, how has the Italian discussion around vaccination changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and have the unprecedented events of 2020-2021 been able to break the echo chamber around this topic? We use a Twitter dataset spanning September 2019 - November 2021 to examine the state of polarization around vaccination. We propose a hierarchical clustering approach to find the largest communities in the endorsement networks of different time periods, and manually illustrate that it produces communities of users sharing a stance. Examining the structure of these networks, as well as textual content of their interactions, we find the stark division between supporters and hesitant individuals to continue throughout the vaccination campaign. However, we find an increasing commonality in the topical focus of the vaccine supporters and vaccine hesitant, pointing to a possible common set of facts the two sides may agree on. Still, we discover a series of concerns voiced by the hesitant community, ranging from unfounded conspiracies (microchips in vaccines) to public health policy discussion (vaccine passport limitations). We recommend an ongoing surveillance of this debate, especially to uncover concerns around vaccination before the public health decisions and official messaging are made public." />

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract">Italy was the first European country to be hit by COVID-19 in the early 2020, since then losing over 100,000 people to the disease. By the end of the vaccination campaign of 2021, 81% of the public received at least one dose. These dramatic developments were accompanied by a rigorous discussion around vaccination, both about its urgency and its possible negative effects. Twitter is one of the most popular social media platforms in the country, but pre-pandemic vaccination debate has been shown to be polarized and siloed into echo chambers. It is thus imperative to understand the nature of this discourse, with a specific focus on the vaccination hesitant individuals, whose healthcare decisions may affect their communities and the country at large. In this study we ask, how has the Italian discussion around vaccination changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and have the unprecedented events of 2020-2021 been able to break the echo chamber around this topic? We use a Twitter dataset spanning September 2019 - November 2021 to examine the state of polarization around vaccination. We propose a hierarchical clustering approach to find the largest communities in the endorsement networks of different time periods, and manually illustrate that it produces communities of users sharing a stance. Examining the structure of these networks, as well as textual content of their interactions, we find the stark division between supporters and hesitant individuals to continue throughout the vaccination campaign. However, we find an increasing commonality in the topical focus of the vaccine supporters and vaccine hesitant, pointing to a possible common set of facts the two sides may agree on. Still, we discover a series of concerns voiced by the hesitant community, ranging from unfounded conspiracies (microchips in vaccines) to public health policy discussion (vaccine passport limitations). We recommend an ongoing surveillance of this debate, especially to uncover concerns around vaccination before the public health decisions and official messaging are made public.</p>

      <h6 class="card-subtitle">PostDoc Researcher in Digital Epidemiology and Computational Social Science</h6>
      <p class="card-text">I&rsquo;m a physicist by training, currently working as a postdoc at ISI Foundation in Turin. I&rsquo;m part of a group that focuses on using data for social impact. What really fascinates me is how different scientific topics are interconnected, especially when it comes to complex systems. When I first started doing research, it was all about theory—sitting down with pen and paper, trying to understand how microscopic equations could explain the behavior of quantum gases on a larger scale. But during my Ph.D., I shifted gears and started delving into epidemics on temporal networks. This meant combining computer modeling with the good old pen-and-paper approach. As a postdoc, I dived into the world of digital epidemiology. I collected and analyzed Twitter data, initially looking at influenza and vaccines, and later shifting my focus to COVID-19. I didn&rsquo;t stop at social networks though, I also incorporated news and Wikipedia data to study how people seek information about COVID-19 and African swine fever. Alongside all this, I also delved into the theoretical side of hypergraph dynamics. Nowadays, my main focus is on using surveys and contact matrices to understand the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. I&rsquo;m particularly interested in deciphering human behavior in response to this global crisis. My research journey has taken me from studying the tiniest interactions between particles to unraveling the complexities of human interactions, including social behavior and epidemics. It&rsquo;s the interconnectedness of these seemingly different scales that draws me to complexity science. It allows us to tackle questions that span various domains and uncover the hidden connections between them.</p>
