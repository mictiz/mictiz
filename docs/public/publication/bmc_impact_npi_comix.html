<meta name="description" content="Most countries around the world enforced non-pharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19. Italy was one of the first countries to be affected by the pandemic, imposing a hard lockdown, in the first epidemic wave. During the second wave, the country implemented progressively restrictive tiers at the regional level according to weekly epidemiological risk assessments. This paper quantifies the impact of these restrictions on contacts and on the reproduction number. Representative (with respect to age, sex, and region of residence) longitudinal surveys of the Italian population were undertaken during the second epidemic wave. Epidemiologically relevant contact patterns were measured and compared with pre-pandemic levels and according to the level of interventions experienced by the participants. Contact matrices were used to quantify the reduction in the number of contacts by age group and contact setting. The reproduction number was estimated to evaluate the impact of restrictions on the spread of COVID-19. The comparison with the pre-pandemic baseline shows a significant decrease in the number of contacts, independently from the age group or contact settings. This decrease in the number of contacts significantly depends on the strictness of the non-pharmaceutical interventions. For all levels of strictness considered, the reduction in social mixing results in a reproduction number smaller than one. In particular, the impact of the restriction on the number of contacts decreases with the severity of the interventions. The progressive restriction tiers implemented in Italy reduced the reproduction number, with stricter interventions associated with higher reductions. Readily collected contact data can inform the implementation of mitigation measures at the national level in epidemic emergencies to come." />

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract">Most countries around the world enforced non-pharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19. Italy was one of the first countries to be affected by the pandemic, imposing a hard lockdown, in the first epidemic wave. During the second wave, the country implemented progressively restrictive tiers at the regional level according to weekly epidemiological risk assessments. This paper quantifies the impact of these restrictions on contacts and on the reproduction number. Representative (with respect to age, sex, and region of residence) longitudinal surveys of the Italian population were undertaken during the second epidemic wave. Epidemiologically relevant contact patterns were measured and compared with pre-pandemic levels and according to the level of interventions experienced by the participants. Contact matrices were used to quantify the reduction in the number of contacts by age group and contact setting. The reproduction number was estimated to evaluate the impact of restrictions on the spread of COVID-19. The comparison with the pre-pandemic baseline shows a significant decrease in the number of contacts, independently from the age group or contact settings. This decrease in the number of contacts significantly depends on the strictness of the non-pharmaceutical interventions. For all levels of strictness considered, the reduction in social mixing results in a reproduction number smaller than one. In particular, the impact of the restriction on the number of contacts decreases with the severity of the interventions. The progressive restriction tiers implemented in Italy reduced the reproduction number, with stricter interventions associated with higher reductions. Readily collected contact data can inform the implementation of mitigation measures at the national level in epidemic emergencies to come.</p>

      <h6 class="card-subtitle">PostDoc Researcher in Digital Epidemiology and Computational Social Science</h6>
      <p class="card-text">I&rsquo;m a physicist by training, currently working as a postdoc at ISI Foundation in Turin. I&rsquo;m part of a group that focuses on using data for social impact. What really fascinates me is how different scientific topics are interconnected, especially when it comes to complex systems. When I first started doing research, it was all about theory—sitting down with pen and paper, trying to understand how microscopic equations could explain the behavior of quantum gases on a larger scale. But during my Ph.D., I shifted gears and started delving into epidemics on temporal networks. This meant combining computer modeling with the good old pen-and-paper approach. As a postdoc, I dived into the world of digital epidemiology. I collected and analyzed Twitter data, initially looking at influenza and vaccines, and later shifting my focus to COVID-19. I didn&rsquo;t stop at social networks though, I also incorporated news and Wikipedia data to study how people seek information about COVID-19 and African swine fever. Alongside all this, I also delved into the theoretical side of hypergraph dynamics. Nowadays, my main focus is on using surveys and contact matrices to understand the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. I&rsquo;m particularly interested in deciphering human behavior in response to this global crisis. My research journey has taken me from studying the tiniest interactions between particles to unraveling the complexities of human interactions, including social behavior and epidemics. It&rsquo;s the interconnectedness of these seemingly different scales that draws me to complexity science. It allows us to tackle questions that span various domains and uncover the hidden connections between them.</p>
