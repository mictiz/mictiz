# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I'm a physicist by training, currently working as a postdoc at ISI Foundation in Turin. I'm part of a group that focuses on using data for social impact. What really fascinates me is how different scientific topics are interconnected, especially when it comes to complex systems. When I first started doing research, it was all about theory—sitting down with pen and paper, trying to understand how microscopic equations could explain the behavior of quantum gases on a larger scale. But during my Ph.D., I shifted gears and started delving into epidemics on temporal networks. This meant combining computer modeling with the good old pen-and-paper approach. As a postdoc, I dived into the world of digital epidemiology. I collected and analyzed Twitter data, initially looking at influenza and vaccines, and later shifting my focus to COVID-19. I didn't stop at social networks though, I also incorporated news and Wikipedia data to study how people seek information about COVID-19 and African swine fever. Alongside all this, I also delved into the theoretical side of hypergraph dynamics. Nowadays, my main focus is on using surveys and contact matrices to understand the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm particularly interested in deciphering human behavior in response to this global crisis. My research journey has taken me from studying the tiniest interactions between particles to unraveling the complexities of human interactions, including social behavior and epidemics. It's the interconnectedness of these seemingly different scales that draws me to complexity science. It allows us to tackle questions that span various domains and uncover the hidden connections between them.
